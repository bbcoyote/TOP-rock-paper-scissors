# TOP-rock-paper-scissors

My TOP project for rock paper scissors

At this time this is a game that is played in the console. in order to play a round open the developer tools console and type
playRound() to start the game. a prompt will appear on the page and you can choose rock, paper or scissors. Then the computer and user inputs are logged to the console and a win or lose message is displayed in the console.

The computer will randomly generate a choice after entering your choice.

I have a problem with a function in my project. I have a function
called game() that calls playRound() 5 times. the prompts appear and I can enter a selection, after each selection the selections are logged but after the 5th prompt selection in the console it returns undefined..
